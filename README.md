# belly-button-challenge
## This challenge was a little disgusting and far too satisfying.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.  This script, app.js, will show an interactive dashboard of the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.

Data was obtained from the following URL:  https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json.

We wrote this inside of a function so every selection triggers the same responses.

Finally, this will be published at https://ksniderbel.github.io/site/.

This work was done with other students:  Haritha Koleti, Michelle Petras, and Carment Wiggens.
